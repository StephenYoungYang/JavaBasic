# Java IO
Java I/O (Input and Output) is used to process the input and produce the output.  
It uses Decorator Pattern to implement its structure.

## Stream
In Java, 3 streams are created for us automatically. All these streams are attached with the console.
1. System.out: standard output stream
2. System.in: standard input stream
3. System.err: standard error stream

## OutputStream vs InputStream
outputStream: Java application uses an output stream to write data to a destination; it may be a file, an array, peripheral device or socket.
inputStream: Java application uses an input stream to read data from a source; it may be a file, an array, peripheral device or socket.
